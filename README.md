# In From The Side Movie Watch Online
  
What does the concept of American freedom and independence even mean for a community full of drug addicts, strippers, war veterans, and ex-convicts living on the margins of society in a Southern small town? This detailed portrait of Louisiana residents from low-income backgrounds reveals how easy it is to despise people who are more inclined to be racist and militaristic regardless of what their life stories are or the difficulties they face in their daily lives. This feature film based on real characters and stories creates the illusion of a documentary that acts as a socio-critical and empathetic study of "rednecks" excluded from liberal-democratic discourse.(IDFF Ji.hlava)
 
In this series, Arthur Laffer, economic advisor to Ronald Reagan and Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient, explores the economic history of America over the last century to reveal the principles and policies that have promoted prosperity in our economy.

This new teaching series combines elements of an online course and a documentary to present these timeless economic principles that will help you discover how economic policies should be rooted in a common sense understanding of human nature.
 
It tells the truth about supply-side economics, the impact of taxes and how the economy really works. And it does this in a way that anyone can understand it, regardless of their educational background or expertise.
 
Supply-Side Economics and American Prosperity with Arthur B. Laffer is spot-on, extremely relevant and current. He shares/teaches the pertinent and important information so that everyone can grasp the concepts. Very enjoyable and relevant.
 
Great movies do more than entertain us. They move us, inspire us and make us feel something. And if they're really good, they get us thinking and may even move us to action. Join us for At the Movies, July 14-August 18, where we'll dive into film together in order to get busy thinking and acting on what we discover about God, ourselves and the life he desires for us... and we'll be sure to enjoy free popcorn and soda all along the way, too. We'll see you At the Movies!

In the year since that humble start, over more than 50 episodes, he has built a feverishly devoted base of half a million subscribers and growing. They tune in to watch Doolaard, who uses a single tripod-mounted camera, the occasional drone, Google Sketch, a suite of power tools, and an almost preternatural sense of calm as he tackles a seemingly never-ending list of tasks involved in trying to make a home from a pair of century-old buildings that lack heat, plumbing, and electricity.
 
In videos, his look, while not necessarily contradicting his usual style, can accurately be called timeless, a feeling he sought to impart more broadly by stripping out some of the ugly mundanities of modern life in favor of a rural fantasia.
 
Being truly alone in the modern world, or living absolutely off the grid, is an almost impossible task. Doolaard is giving it an honest go, but he has his limits. That scything he appreciated? The sheer scale of his property proved overwhelming, so he hired a few local guys to hack down the rampant summer growth with string trimmers.
 
According to research consultancy and analyst firm Gartner, by 2021, 90% of web applications will have more exposed attack surface area as APIs rather than direct user interfaces on a website or in a mobile app. Unfortunately, many web application operators have not yet caught up to this thinking. Recent API vulnerabilities and attacks have been reported on applications run by exercise company Peloton, credit report provider Experian and the red-hot audio chat startup Clubhouse.
 
The API attackers are following the trends of online shopping. Modern ecommerce relies on APIs to expose essential functionalities, such as shopping carts, on multiple platforms. Cybercriminals have recognized that bot-driven API attacks are easier than account takeovers (ATOs) or other forms of attacks.
 
Criminals can mount API attacks with less infrastructure than other kinds of attacks. Because APIs are machine-to-machine connections, it is easier for an attacker to mask their identity because API communications contain much less information for identifying patterns of attacks. For retailers that want to protect their customers, reputations, and brands, properly protecting their APIs is crucial to doing business in the connected age.
 
An API is a way to allow direct connections, communications and data sharing between applications in a platform and technology-agnostic manner. APIs enable all types of devices or partner and affiliate services to ask a question or send information to an application safely and securely. APIs have become a crucial glue that enables the maze of internal and external services making up modern applications to talk to each other in an automated fashion. An API attack is hostile usage or attempted hostile usage of an API.
 
Because APIs are programmatic in nature, criminals like to use automated attacks against them. There are many types of API attacks, including Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), injection attacks, authentication hijacking and application abuse. Among these attack types, application abuse is the primary concern for ecommerce operators.
 
Many factors make API attacks even more dangerous than traditional attacks on user interfaces such as websites or mobile apps. API calls have less identifying information about the user or device requesting the information. This gives automated attack blocking technology fewer clues to identify bad API calls sent by malicious bots.
 
For example, in an API call, there is no information about how a user moves around a page or how long it takes them to move from one page to another. These data points help detect bots using JavaScript that automates human navigation. APIs query directly into an application, bypassing the need to navigate an app or webpage.
 
In addition, APIs are often not as tightly secured as web applications. Well-disguised API calls can elude legacy security controls such as web application firewalls or API gateways when attackers design these calls to be nearly identical to legitimate API calls from genuine shoppers. Even more troubling, exposed APIs allow attackers to bypass the client side of applications entirely and directly reach databases and application tiers. This creates far more exposure and risk because these assets may have steady access to sensitive information or the ability to alter application behavior in malicious ways.
 
For example, many ecommerce applications use the same API for receiving and responding to queries routed from their website, mobile apps, affiliates, or partners. Using a single API makes it easier for attackers to hide their identity and avoid detection. Standard detection measures are easier to tune if the API has a single use rather than multiple uses. This problem is multiplied with the newer generation of unified APIs powered by a query language called GraphQL. GrapQL can use APIs more efficiently, but GraphQL APIs are harder to lock down due to how they structure their calls and communications with external parties.
 
Another frequent oversight is not treating internal and external APIs with the same security measures. In theory, internal APIs are not supposed to receive external traffic. In practice, clever criminals are getting better versed in how to find and compromise internal APIs. For example, a growing number of attacks target the Amazon Web Services S3 storage service. Ecommerce applications often access S3 as an internal API, meant to be insulated from the outside world.
 
Application development teams often do not deploy standard security practices such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), which encrypts data to protect payment and personal information, on internal APIs. More broadly, application development teams do not spend as much time and effort auditing and securing their APIs because they still view direct attacks on their web applications as the biggest threat they face. Also, they tend to be less well-versed in the gritty details of API attacks. For these reasons, they are less likely to examine API query behaviors and are less aware of patterns of anomalies.
 
Ecommerce application development teams that want to shore up their API defenses can start by adopting established best practices. To begin with, application development teams with unified APIs should consider separating them into individual APIs for external traffic to address web apps, mobile apps, third-party partners, suppliers and affiliates. Because retailers may inadvertently expose internal APIs to the public Internet, all API traffic, including internal traffic, should be encrypted with TLS.
